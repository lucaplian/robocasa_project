    Author(s): Rami Alazrai, Ali Awad, Baha Alsaify, Mohammad Hababeh, Mohammad I. Daoud
    Description: Wi-Fi recordings of twelve two-person interactions (approaching, departing, handshaking, high five, 
    hugging, kicking L/R, pointing L/R, punching L/R, pushing) performed by 40 pairs. Each pair repeats every interaction 10 times
    (total 4,800 trials). Files are MATLAB .mat. The data is grouped by pair (one folder per pair), with 120 files per 
    pair (12 interactions x 10 trials). Each trial file is a list of Wi-Fi packets over time. Every packet carries: a timestamp, 
    signal strength (RSSI), and CSI (complex numbers).  Each packet also has a label telling you what was happening at 
    that moment: one of I1-I12 for the specific interaction, or I13 for the steady interval (the subjects stand still 
    before/after the action). This lets you slice exactly the “no-movement” vs “interaction” parts.  ￼
        - If you stack packets in time (rows) and lay out frequencies (columns), you get a matrix/heatmap where color shows 
        how strong the channel is at each frequency at each instant. Movements (e.g., punch vs hug) produce different 
        change patterns over time and across frequencies. That is the information models learn from.  ￼
        - Why values vary: human motion changes reflections and paths of the Wi-Fi signal; each frequency “feels” it differently, 
        so each column (subcarrier) wiggles in its own way. The per-packet labels make it straightforward to align those wiggles 
        with the exact interaction phase.  ￼

    Name: Channel state information (WiFi traces) for 6 activities
    Author(s): Jeroen Klein Brinke, Nirvana Meratnia
    Description:
    This dataset contains WiFi CSI (Channel State Information) recordings of six human activities — clap, walk, wave, jump, sit, and fall — 
    performed by nine people across multiple days in a realistic indoor environment (similar to a living room). The goal is to support 
    research in human activity recognition (HAR) using non-invasive, device-free sensing, without needing people to wear sensors.
    

    Each sample is a short recording of one person performing an activity (e.g., walking or sitting).
	For each sample, the WiFi CSI is recorded in the form of a 3×3×30 matrix:
	-	3 transmit antennas
	-	3 receive antennas
	-	30 subcarriers (frequency channels)

    
	The CSI is captured at 20 samples per second for 5 seconds, so each sample contains up to 100 frames (rows of data).
	The values are real-valued amplitudes that reflect how the WiFi signal was changed by the movement of the person in the room. These changes are caused by reflections, scattering, and absorption of the signal as the person moves.
	The final format is often reshaped to a 70×30×9 matrix, where:
	-	70 = time frames used (one every 0.05 seconds)
	-	30 = subcarriers (frequencies)
	-	9 = combinations of antenna pairs (3 Tx × 3 Rx)

    Name: CSI-HAR Dataset
    Author(s): Parisa Fard Moshiri, Mohammad Nabati, Reza Shahbazian, Seyed Ali Ghorashi
    Description: WiFi CSI captures seven daily human activities, including walk, run, fall, lie down, sit down, stand up, and bend, with code for activity recognition.
    The CSI matrices have 52 columns (available data subcarriers) and 600 up to 1100 rows depending on the period of each activity.
    Initially, there were more subcarriers, but due to removing null and pilot subcarriers, they are reduced to 52 carriers from which we can extract frequency values.
    They reflect amplitude values the complex CSI values, indicating how much signal energy is present at that subcarrier at that point in time. They correspond to the frequencies used for each subcarrier.   
    Due to reflections induced by human activity, each subcarrier for any given link experiences a variation.

    Name: WiFi CSI-Based HAR Dataset
    Author(s): Andrii (Andrew) Zhuravchak
    Description: Wi-Fi recordings for seven everyday activities: walking, sitting, standing, lying, getting up, getting down, 
    and no activity. Collected in multiple rooms to be closer to real-life use. Provided with a paper and code examples for building models.  ￼
        -	Each sample is again a time × frequency matrix derived from packets: rows = moments in time, columns = subcarriers; 
        values = CSI amplitude at that time/frequency. Files also include labels per packet/sequence and, in this dataset, 
        linked images + bounding boxes for the person (useful for cross-modal work, but CSI alone is enough for HAR).  ￼
        -	Why values vary: transitions like get up/get down create short, sharp bursts in the matrix; lying/sitting look steadier;
        walking shows a periodic pattern. The paper discusses how class difficulty correlates with how much data was collected for each
        activity (scarce classes are harder).  ￼
